question was to create highlightHTMLContent function which can accept the three value :
1st htmlContent
2nd plainText
3rd plainTextPositions
and we have to highlight the substring which start from that point and end with the end point

solution:- to solve the problem i have created first 
the function highlightHTMLContent and through the help of map i goes till the length of string where my pointer is not meet with start value and after that by using the slice function we asign the selected substring which we have to hilight therefore we paas that particular substring in function which is highlight_content in loop which convert it in hilighted text;
